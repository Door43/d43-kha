  * **sinless** - This can also be translated as, “had never sinned.”
  * **blood of Jesus** – This could be translated as, “The sacrifice that Jesus made of himself when he died for sinners.” The word “blood” here also means “death.”
  * **God's punishment passes over that person** - This statement means, “God does not punish that person.” Translate it using a phrase that shows its relationship to the words for "Passover" and the "Passover Lamb."
